I don't even know where to start, what to donhow the fuck am i supposed to even do it
let's try thinkung the path first . What are the things I need? Andneed to do?
For the finance tracker instead of the android app, lets make it here first .
 I need a database which keeps the track of dates new data is put and a place to put thr new data. Shhould I make considerations for time element . Nah that would complicate it too much, Lets start simple now.
 Next step is to store thr prices or amounts spent , preferabbly in serial numbers.
I should make a future scope for this project and write down the ideas that are too complicated for me now.Done.
Now for the database let' look at the face reco project. It didn't help. I have to ask gpt , ..... so soon.
Before that I will atleast trygoogling.
22.12.24 .....................
I will use sqlite for the database
I will start from there
First I will create a dictnary to do it then see where it goes from there
23.12.24 ......................
I will try to make the output saved to a file
Lets also try to push this to github and check if I can still see the previous record

  FUTURE SCOPE
  1. Having a Time Element Marking
  2. To Add The Names Of Items the Money is Spent
